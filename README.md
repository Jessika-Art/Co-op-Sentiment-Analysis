# Co-op-Sentiment-Analysis

Have you ever wonder what the people think about a company,
a person, an idea, a group of people or an organisation?

in this simple project I took the people's comments of a given company,
the supermarket chain Co-op in this case in order to see if likes or not.
By using the Twitter API I could take, clean and analyse the comments of the last
200 posts made by Co-op and see if the positive and negative sentiments people having 
when interacting with this company.

Get data, clean data, plot data.
The image WordCloud.png shows the most common words used by the
users.

Of course the data I was able to get are limited by the Twitter policy,
but this shows you an easy way to know what people are thinking about you.
